    <h2><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>AGE</strong>: I'm eighteen

    <p><strong>EDUCATION</strong>: I just currently finished school in Alliance High School, and enrolled at Moringa School to pursue the necessary skills in coding.</p>

    <p><strong>PASSION</strong>: I decided to take a class on programming because I felt like I had a lot of ideas and schemes that I would only execute using programming languages. I believe that through Moringa School, I can gain the experience required to become a qualified developer.</p>

    <p><strong>INTERESTS</strong>: I love being involved in sporting activities such as rugby and football. I also enjoy making music with my friends and uploading the songs up on soundcloud</p>
